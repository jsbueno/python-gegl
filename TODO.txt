Smaller stuff:
- think of a way to connect subgraphs to aux and input ports of nodes
    in other existing graphs
    - improve the graph representation to show the subgraphs
    - refactor the gegl-node creation - what is the role of the outer node?

- create a way to insert new nodes in the graph, taking care of the connections

- have a way to access operation's enums (for example, in "fractal-trace"
- simplify the gegl-node object creation in gegl.Graph
   (do we "need" the outer node?)
- fix the represenation for complex graphs
- make properties accept "-" containing properties replacing then with "_"
   with python property syntax


Major stuff:
- import and export Graphs from XML
- being able to set up graphs as meta-operations
  *(require GEGL hacking)
