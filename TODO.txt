Smaller stuff:
- create a way to insert new nodes in the graph, taking care of the connections
- improve the graph representation to show the connections
    ** includes getting a way to check wich nodes are connected to what.
    right now node.get_consumers call is simply crashing - apparently a bug
    in Pygobject.
    *** workaround with a Python structure listing the nodes?
- have a way to access operation's enums (for example, in "fractal-trace")
- test


Major stuff:
- import and export Graphs from XML
- being ble to set up graphs as meta-operations
  *(require GEGL hacking)
